        <h2>My experience</h2>
        <p>I'm right at the start of my coding/software engineering journey. I've been using freeCodeCamp to learn the basics, and I've just finished their HTML section.</p>
        <h2>My life</h2>
        <p>To be honest, there's not much to it. I'm 21, from near Oxford in the UK and I've always been pretty interested in computers.
            Up until now, I've never really had the time to delegate to actually learning to code, I tried a little bit when I was younger
            but I've always been fairly immature and easily distracted.<br> 
            But I came to a conclusion a few days ago. I lost my job as a bus driver and I decided that whilst I have the time and a little
            bit of extra money, I would try and focus on coding and actually learn some skills that may well make me a dab-hand at something
            for once!<br>
            I appreciate that there is a lot to HTML as the <strong>backbone</strong> of making web applications and structuring sites,
            but I'm able to learn quickly and adapt to things as they come my way. Admittedly, the freeCodeCamp course is <em>fairly</em> basic
            by all accounts, but I've learned valuable things through it, like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lists... (ordered and unordered)</li>
            <li>Basic formatting (boilerplate) of HTML</li>
            <li>HTML tables (which I'm unlikely to be able to show on this site, but I might find a way).</li>
            <li>HTML forms, which I'm sure I'll be able to show on the <a href="./contact.html">contact</a> page.</li>
            <li>Accessibility and using ARIA to make things work for assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
            <li><strong>and lot's more...</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>But for now, that's my life (that I want to share on the web anyway!) see ya around.</p>
